Homework 2

Problem: Implement a 5-armed bandit problem with greedy and e-greedy 
action selection algorithms. Compare the results of e-greedy action 
selection method (e=0.4) with the greedy one. Which one works better 
over 100 time-steps in 200 runs? You can choose any distribution/values 
for your reward function and/or other parameters.
